## ðŸŽˆ Considerations

First of all I want to thank you for the opportunity to be on this test. It has been a really nice process since Julian answered my application, the interview and the tech challenge were both great! I hope you like my application and we can collaborate on awesome projects in the future.

## ðŸ‘¾ Notes

- I didn't want to use components libraries because I expect to show you how I can componentize the application. I also design the project for growth, the components are structured to be reused as much as possible.
- I didn't use any of memo, useMemo or useCallback because in my opinion it was going to be a premature optimization and the cost would be higher than the normal rendering process of React. (I wrote an article about it [here](https://gustavowarmling.hashnode.dev/are-you-using-the-memo-hook-in-the-correct-way))
- I made the responsive version of the app
- Styled components was chosen because it is a modern, scalable and "natural" way to develop React applications
- I know that my testing skills aren't my stronggest point but I just bought the Kent C. Dodds course to make it better
- I chose, instead of using 3 breakpoints, to use responsiveness techniques in the CSS so that it will adapt to any screen size
